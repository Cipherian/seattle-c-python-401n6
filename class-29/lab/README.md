# Lab: Django with Style

## Overview

We have a need to update our administration users in our Snacks site. It is time to build out a custom user model.

In addition, our Snacks projects could use a little more style. Lets look at some new tools.

Let's change that by checking out a new kind of "utility first" CSS toolkit named [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"}.

We will also look at something called [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/). This tool will provide us easy access to pre-build css code for us to use in our projects.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Building upon previous lab, your job is to
  - Delete your existing database and files in the migration folder.
  - Update to a custom user model.
  - Give your site some style.

## Implementation Notes

- Follow the [Tailwind CSS Django - Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/django/){:target="_blank"} instructions to add Flowbite and Tailwind to your html templates.
  - That will probably be "base.html"
- Be sure to look at the left menu bar on Flowbite to get demo examples.

### User Acceptance Tests

- No additional acceptance tests required.

## Configuration

- Create new branch on previous lab's repo named `django-with-style`.

Refer to [Lab Submission Instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/){:target="_blank"} for detailed instructions.

## Stretch

- Add an additional application to your project with it's own model.


## Big Stretch
- Can you implement another database?  How?
- Deploy your site somewhere.
